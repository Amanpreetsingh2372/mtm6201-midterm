## Files
- `index.html` — Home page
- `team.html` — Team page
- `process.html` — How it works
- `site.css` — Styling (distinct from other submission)
- `assets/` — image files & mockups (please add exported small & large images here)

## Notes
- Replace placeholder images in `assets/` with two sizes for each image (small and large) and update src/srcset if you change filenames.
- The code includes accessibility basics: skip links, semantic headings, aria attributes on the menu.
- Use GitHub Pages to host this repository (enable Pages in repository settings).

## How to deploy
1. Create repository `mtm6201-midterm-nutritionist-2`.
2. Add these files and an `assets/` folder with images.
3. Push to GitHub; enable Pages and serve from `main` branch root.
